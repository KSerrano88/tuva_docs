Connectors are code (typically dbt packages) that transform standard healthcare data formats into the `Input Layer` so they can automatically be transformed into the Tuva data model.  We are building connectors for as many standard healthcare data sources as possible.  We currently have connectors for the following standard data formats listed below.  We welcome the creation of additional connectors by the community!
